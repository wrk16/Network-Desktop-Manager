## Network-Desktop-Manager
This is a Computer Networking project using JAVA in my pre final year.

## Abstract:
This project aims to create a Network Desktop Manager (NDM) using Java for centralized management and remote control of computers in a LAN. It includes:

-Network Communication: Utilizing socket programming for robust communication between client desktops and the server.<br>
-Administrative Capabilities: Remote access to client desktop configuration settings and operations like desktop sharing and file sharing for administrators.<br>
-User Interface: Intuitive GUI for both administrators and clients, enabling desktop assistance requests and server-side tasks.<br>
-Learning Outcomes: Hands-on experience in Java GUI development, socket programming, and practical network administration fundamentals within a LAN environment.<br>

## Introduction:
This project aims to build a "Network Desktop Manager," a Java application that enables connected computers within a local area network (LAN) to communicate and collaborate more effectively. By utilizing socket programming, the Manager facilitates direct communication between devices, allowing for features like:<br>
•	Remote Desktop Sharing: View and control another computer's screen for troubleshooting or assistance.<br>
•	File Sharing: Easily transfer files between devices on the network.<br>
•	Centralized Management: Network administrators can monitor and manage client desktop configurations, ensuring system updates and security.<br>
•	User Interaction: Both administrators and clients can interact with the Manager through a user-friendly graphical interface, making managing the network intuitive and convenient.<br>
Developing this project will not only enhance the skills in Java GUI development and socket programming but also provide valuable insight into network administration practices within a LAN environment.

a. Setup:<br>
•	Import necessary libraries (java.net, java.io, etc.).<br>
•	Create a ServerSocket object, specifying a port number for communication.<br>
•	Initialize data structures to store client information and configuration settings.<br>

b. Connection Handling:<br>
•	Continuously listen for incoming client connections using ServerSocket.accept().<br>

o	Store client information (username, IP address, etc.) in the data structure.<br>

c. Thread Operations:<br>
•	Implement functionality for: <br>
o	Receiving and processing client requests (file transfers, remote desktop access, configuration updates).<br>
o	Sending responses and data back to clients.<br>
o	Handling file transfers using input/output streams.<br>
o	Managing remote desktop sharing using appropriate libraries or techniques.<br>
o	Storing and retrieving configuration settings in files or a database.<br>
o	Implementing administrative actions (creating folders, renaming files, etc.).<br>
o	Handling authentication and authorization for administrative tasks.<br>

2. Client-Side:<br>
   
a. Setup:<br>
•	Import necessary libraries (java.net, java.io, etc.).<br>
•	Create a Socket object, connecting to the server's IP address and port.<br>
•	Create input/output streams for communication with the server.<br>

b. User Interaction:<br>
•	Implement a user interface (console-based or GUI) for:<br> 
o	Entering credentials for authentication.<br>
o	Selecting actions (file transfers, requesting remote desktop access, etc.).<br>
o	Providing file paths and filenames for transfers.<br>

c. Request Handling:<br>
•	Send requests and data to the server through the socket's output stream.<br>
•	Receive responses and data from the server through the input stream.<br>
•	Display server responses and file transfer progress in the console or GUI.<br>
•	Handle remote desktop sharing interactions as appropriate.<br>
