# Network-Desktop-Manager
Computer Networking project using JAVA in my pre final year 
This project aims to create a Network Desktop Manager (NDM) using Java for centralized management and remote control of computers in a LAN. It includes:

*Network Communication: Utilizing socket programming for robust communication between client desktops and the server.

*Administrative Capabilities: Remote access to client desktop configuration settings and operations like desktop sharing and file sharing for administrators.

*User Interface: Intuitive GUI for both administrators and clients, enabling desktop assistance requests and server-side tasks.

*Learning Outcomes: Hands-on experience in Java GUI development, socket programming, and practical network administration fundamentals within a LAN environment.
